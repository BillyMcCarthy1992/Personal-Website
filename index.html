    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I recently completed my PhD in Philosophy at Columbia University (2024), where my research focused on the foundations of mathematics, pluralism, 
      and the intersection of logic with ethics. 
      My dissertation motivated and developed a pluralist approach to higher-order logic, and examined some implications for the foundations of mathematics, 
      metaphysics, and broader questions about the role of logic in our ethical frameworks. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My current research examines the role of artificial intelligence in mathematics, 
      with a focus on automated theorem proving, the aesthetics of mathematical practice, and the limits of formalism. 
      I am particularly interested in how developments in AI challenge traditional views of mathematical reasoning and creativity, 
      and in drawing parallels between the “artworld” and the “mathworld.” 
      This work aims to shed light on the philosophical, aesthetic, and social dimensions of mathematical practice in an age of increasingly intelligent machines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside my academic work, I have developed strong technical skills in Python programming and am now 
      transitioning into the field of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My goal is to bring 
      together my background in logic, mathematics, and philosophy with practical coding and AI expertise 
      to contribute to building intelligent systems that are transparent, ethical, and aligned with human values.
